# Programmer Essentials
The programmer essentials is a repository which contains several packages to help the budding programmers with routine tasks.
I encourage other developers to contribute in this project with their suggestions and use this as ground to show their creativity using new languages such as Golang and Rust.

## Projects
1. Matrix: A Network Diagnostics Tool written in Golang.
2. Refurnish: A File Operations Tool written in Rust.
3. Spine: A CLI based text editor written in rust.
