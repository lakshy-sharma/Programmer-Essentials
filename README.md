# Programmer Essentials
The programmer essentials is a repository which contains several packages to help the budding programmers with routine tasks.
I encourage other developers to contribute in this project with their suggestions and use this as ground to show their creativity using new languages such as Golang and Rust.

Each project has its own readme. Describing the goals and progress.
